**1. A simpler interface**
- Reduced the number of icons on the homepage from 14 to 7 + 1 (with more)
- Created a hamburger that opens from the left to allow some features like the delivery stages and language settings to always be easily available

**2. Search Translator**
- Users can type words from different languages into the search bar and the prompts will be generated in both the typed language and the language of the account. 
- This is very helpful for the ‘tip of the tongue’ syndrome, especially when bilinguals can remember the word in one language but not in the other. 
- Users will not lose out in terms of being unable to access the more popular products even if they search in a different language.
- This will be much more convenient as compared to having users do their own translation before doing the search.

**3. Augmented Reality Try-it**
- This connects to the camera and allows the user to see themselves with an item of clothing like a try-on feature. 
- It also allows them to directly like the product from that camera screen

**4. Shake that Boot**
- Similar to how GooglePay gives its users a chance to benefit from a cashback or discount system with a lucky draw element when they use the app. Users shake a yellow rubber boot and an avatar comes out to tell the users what they have won.
- Inspired by Phua Chu Kang's boots
